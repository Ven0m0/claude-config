            REPOSITORY: Claude Code Skills Marketplace
            This repository contains a collection of Claude Code skills and plugins that extend Claude's capabilities.

            CRITICAL SECURITY FOCUS:
            As a skills marketplace, this codebase requires rigorous security review. Skills can execute arbitrary code, hooks, and bash commands, making them potential vectors for:
            - Downloading external binaries or malicious code
            - Data exfiltration (sending local files/data to external services)
            - Arbitrary code execution without user consent
            - Privilege escalation
            - Credential theft
            - Supply chain attacks

            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ steps.pr-number.outputs.number }}

            Please perform a security-focused review of this pull request, paying special attention to:

            1. **Script Execution**: Review all bash commands, hooks, and executable code
               - Check for curl/wget downloads of external binaries
               - Look for eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution
               - Verify all external resources are from trusted sources

            2. **Data Exfiltration**:
               - Check for network requests to external services
               - Look for file reads combined with external transmissions
               - Verify logging doesn't expose sensitive data

            3. **Hook Security**:
               - Review hook configurations for malicious patterns
               - Check for hooks that modify files without user consent
               - Verify hooks don't bypass security controls

            4. **Skill Permissions**:
               - Review tool permissions and scopes
               - Check for overly broad file system access
               - Verify skills request minimal necessary permissions

            5. **Code Quality & Best Practices**:
               - Potential bugs or logic errors
               - Performance issues
               - Proper error handling
