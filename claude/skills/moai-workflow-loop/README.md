# Workflow loop skill (stripped for this repo)

This skill described the MoAI-ADK feedback loop (`/moai:loop`, MoAILSPClient, `.moai/cache/.moai_loop_state.json`, etc.). MoAI-dependent content has been removed for this repo.

- For **workflow and phase behavior**, see `claude/rules/workflow/`.
- For **loop/iteration patterns**, use generic Task() delegation and completion checks; no MoAI-ADK runtime required.
