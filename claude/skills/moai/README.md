# MoAI skill (stripped for this repo)

This folder originally contained MoAI-ADK workflow content (plan, run, sync, fix, loop, etc.). MoAI-dependent lines have been removed or generalized for use in this repo.

- For **SPEC / plan-run-sync** workflow, see `claude/rules/workflow/workflow-modes.md` (repo-customized, no `/moai` commands).
- For the full MoAI-ADK experience, see the upstream project: https://github.com/modu-ai/moai-adk

Files here are kept for reference but may still contain some MoAI-specific paths or commands; treat as legacy and prefer the rules in `claude/rules/workflow/`.
