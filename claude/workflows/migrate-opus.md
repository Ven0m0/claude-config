# Migrate CLAUDE.md for Opus 4.5+

Stub workflow for adjusting CLAUDE.md and project instructions for Opus 4.5+ behavior.

## When to use

- Upgrading to Opus 4.5 or later and want to tune instructions.
- Official migration guidance: see [Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs) for model-specific notes.

## Steps

1. Read current CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.
2. Apply any documented Opus 4.5+ recommendations (e.g. extended thinking, tool use).
3. Keep instruction budget in check; prefer pointers over long inline content.
4. Re-run audit workflow to verify quality after changes.
