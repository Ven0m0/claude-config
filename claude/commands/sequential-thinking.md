description: Solve complex problems through iterative step-by-step thinking
category: utilities-debugging
---

Use sequential-thinking for complex problems requiring deep analysis:
1. Initial analysis - understand and decompose the problem
2. Hypothesis generation - formulate potential solutions
3. Verification - test hypotheses and revise
4. Branching - explore multiple solution paths
5. Integration - derive optimal solution

Ideal for: system design, performance optimization, security design, complex debugging.
