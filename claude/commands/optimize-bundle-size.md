Optimize bundle size:

1. Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer or vite-bundle-visualizer
1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes/components
1. Enable tree shaking and dead code elimination
1. Replace large dependencies with lighter alternatives
1. Configure compression (gzip/brotli)
1. Measure savings and document improvements
