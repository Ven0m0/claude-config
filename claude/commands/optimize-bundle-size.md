Optimize bundle size:
1. Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer or vite-bundle-visualizer
2. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for routes/components
3. Enable tree shaking and dead code elimination
4. Replace large dependencies with lighter alternatives
5. Configure compression (gzip/brotli)
6. Measure savings and document improvements
