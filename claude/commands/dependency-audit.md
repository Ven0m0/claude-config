Perform dependency security audit:
1. Identify dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
2. Run security audit: `npm audit`, `uvx pip-audit`, `cargo audit`
3. Check for outdated packages and available updates
4. Analyze severity levels and CVE references
5. Create prioritized update plan with remediation steps
6. Document findings and recommendations
