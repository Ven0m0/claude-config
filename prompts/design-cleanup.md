Analyze this existing design and perfect its foundational elements by implementing the following enhancements:

VISUAL HIERARCHY & TYPOGRAPHY:
- Establish a proper typographic scale using a 1.25 ratio (12px, 15px, 18px, 24px, 30px, 37px, 46px)
- Ensure consistent font weights (300/light, 400/regular, 600/semibold, 700/bold) with clear purpose
- Perfect line heights (1.2 for headings, 1.5 for body text, 1.4 for UI elements)
- Fix letter spacing (-0.02em for large text, 0 for body, +0.05em for small caps)
- Create clear information hierarchy using size, color, and spacing relationships

COLOR & CONTRAST OPTIMIZATION:
- Audit all color combinations for WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- Establish a cohesive color palette with primary, secondary, and semantic colors
- Create consistent color variants (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900)
- Perfect color usage: primary for actions, secondary for info, semantic for status
- Ensure dark mode compatibility with appropriate color inversions

SPACING & LAYOUT REFINEMENT:
- Implement consistent spacing system using 4px/8px base unit (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
- Perfect component padding and margins for visual balance
- Establish consistent border radius values (2px, 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px)
- Optimize white space distribution for breathing room and focus
- Align all elements to an invisible grid system for precision

COMPONENT STANDARDIZATION:
- Unify button styles with consistent heights (32px, 40px, 48px), padding, and states
- Standardize form inputs with consistent sizing, spacing, and interaction states
- Perfect icon sizing and alignment (16px, 20px, 24px, 32px) with optical balance
- Ensure consistent card/container styling with unified shadows and borders
- Create cohesive loading, empty, and error state designs

OUTPUT: Provide the enhanced design with detailed annotations explaining each improvement and a style guide showing the perfected design system.
